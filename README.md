# Stof VS Code Extension

Syntax highlighting for the [Stof](https://docs.stof.dev) project.

Stof is a unified data interface and interchange format for creating, sharing, and manipulating data. Stof removes the fragile and cumbersome parts of combining and using data in applications.

## Features

For now, this extension only provides syntax highlighting to make Stof look a bit nicer. This extension will need a lot of work in the future - you're welcome to contribute if you'd like! Take a look at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dev-formata-io/stof-vscode) for details.
